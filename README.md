# Decentralized Framework for Investment in White Hydrogen

## Overview
This repository contains the architectural diagram and a Canva presentation for a decentralized framework aimed at facilitating investments in white hydrogen (natural hydrogen) projects. This framework leverages DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and blockchain technology to streamline funding and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

## Components

### 1. Investors
- **Description**: Individuals or entities providing capital for hydrogen projects.
- **Interaction**: Funds are sent to DeFi protocols for pooling and allocation.

### 2. DeFi Protocols
- **Description**: Platforms that manage decentralized financial transactions.
- **Interaction**: Pool funds from investors and interact with smart contracts to allocate funds to hydrogen producers.

### 3. Smart Contracts
- **Description**: Self-executing contracts that automate the allocation of funds.
- **Interaction**: Distribute funds to hydrogen producers based on predefined rules and conditions.

### 4. Hydrogen Producers
- **Description**: Entities involved in the extraction and production of white hydrogen.
- **Interaction**: Receive funding from smart contracts to support hydrogen production and distribution.

### 5. Regulators
- **Description**: Authorities ensuring compliance with legal and environmental standards.
- **Interaction**: Monitor DeFi transactions and hydrogen production activities to ensure regulatory compliance.

## Architectural Diagram
The architectural diagram visually represents the interactions between the key components of the framework. Below is a simplified representation:

[Investors] --> (Investment) --> [DeFi Protocols] --> (Funds Pooling) --> [Smart Contracts] --> (Funds Allocation) --> [Hydrogen Producers]

[Regulators] -- (Compliance Monitoring) --> [DeFi Protocols]
[Regulators] -- (Compliance Monitoring) --> [Hydrogen Producers] 



## Canva Presentation
A detailed Canva presentation has been created to further explain the decentralized framework for investment in white hydrogen. The presentation includes visual aids and a comprehensive breakdown of each component and their interactions.
